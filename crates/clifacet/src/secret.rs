//! A value the framework is allowed to carry but not to show.
//!
//! A credential in a [`Secret`] is redacted wherever the framework speaks — a
//! diagnostic an application writes, a preview a screen draws, a record a test keeps —
//! because those places print values through [`Debug`] or [`Display`], and both of
//! [`Secret`]'s implementations are the same marker.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use clifacet::secret::{REDACTED, Secret};
//!
//! let token = Secret::new(String::from("sk-live-1234"));
//!
//! assert_eq!(format!("{token}"), REDACTED);
//! assert_eq!(format!("{token:?}"), "Secret([redacted])");
//! assert_eq!(token.expose(), "sk-live-1234");
//! ```
//!
//! The type is a promise about the framework's own output, not a guarantee about the
//! program. [`Secret::expose`] is deliberately the only way to read the value, so
//! every place that reads it is a place someone wrote, but nothing stops an
//! application from writing it to a log. See `docs/command-core.md` for what this
//! cannot cover.
