//! Library-owned failure categories for the UI-free command core.
//!
//! A command can fail in three places, and the difference matters to a caller: the
//! input can be rejected before the command ever runs ([`Failure::validation`]),
//! the command can run and fail ([`Failure::execution`]), or the user can stop an
//! interactive flow before it produces input at all ([`Failure::cancelled`]). All
//! three travel as one type so every presentation layer — flags today, prompts and
//! a TUI later — reports them the same way, and so an application cannot mistake a
//! cancellation for bad input.
//!
//! Exit codes are deliberately *not* here. decision-3 keeps output and exit
//! mapping application-owned, so this type answers "what kind of failure is
//! this?" and the application decides what that costs.
